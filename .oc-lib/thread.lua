-- Thread Handle API

---@class OC.ThreadHandle
local thread_handle_api = {}

---@alias OC.ThreadHandle.Status
---| "running"
---| "suspended"
---| "dead"

--- Resumes (or thaws) a suspended thread.
--- 
--- Returns success and an error message on failure.
--- 
--- A thread begins its life already in a running state and thus basic thread workflows will not ever need to call `t:resume()`.
--- A “running” thread will autonomously continue until it completes.
--- `t:resume()` is only necessary to resume a thread that has been suspended(`t:suspend()`).
--- 
--- Note that because you are not directly resuming the thread any exceptions thrown from the thread are absorbed by the threading library and not exposed to your process.
---@return boolean, string?
function thread_handle_api:resume() end

--- Suspends (or freezes) a running thread.
--- 
--- Returns success and an error message on failure.
--- 
--- A “suspended” thread never autonomously wakes up, and dies as soon as its parent process (if attached) closes.
--- 
--- A suspended thread ignores events. That means any event listeners or timers created inside the thread will not respond to event notifications.
--- 
--- Note that threads do not buffer event signals and a suspended thread may miss event signals it was waiting for.
--- 
--- For example, if a thread was last waiting on `event.pull("modem_message")` and is “suspended” and a “modem_message” is received by the computer then the thread will miss the event and never know it happened.
--- 
--- Please note that if you suspend a thread that is blocked waiting for an event, it is unspecified which event the thread will receive when it is next resumed.
--- 
--- Note: Suspending the current thread causes the thread to immediately yield and does not resume until `t:resume()` is called explicitly elsewhere. 
---@return boolean, string?
function thread_handle_api:suspend() end

--- Stabby stab! Kills the thread dead.
--- 
--- The thread is terminated and will not continue its thread function.
--- Any event registrations it made will die with it.
--- 
--- Keep in mind that the core underlying Lua type is a coroutine which is not a preemptive thread.
--- Thus, the thread's stopping points are deterministic, meaning that you can predict exactly where the thread will stop.
function thread_handle_api:kill() end

--- Returns the thread status as a string.
--- - “running”
--- 
---   A running thread will continue (autonomously reactivating) after yields and blocking calls until its thread function exits.
--- 
---   This is the default and initial state of a created thread.
---   A thread remains in the “running” state even when blocked or not active.
--- 
---   A running thread can be suspended(`t:suspend()`) or killed (`t:kill()`) but not resumed(`t:resume()`).
---   A running thread will block calls to `t:join()` and block its parent from closing.
--- 
---   Unlike a coroutine which appears “suspended” when not executing in this very moment, a thread state remains “running” even when waiting for an event.
---
--- - “suspended”
--- 
---   A suspended thread will remain suspended and never self resume execution of its thread function.
--- 
---   A suspended thread is automatically killed when its attached parent closes or when you attempt to `t:join()` it.
---   A suspended thread ignores event signals, and any event registrations made from the context of the thread, or any child threads created therein, also ignore any event signals.
--- 
---   A suspended thread's children behave as if suspended even if their status is “running”.
---   A suspended thread can be resumed(`t:resume()`) or killed (`t:kill()`) but not suspended(`t:suspend()`).
--- 
--- - “dead”
--- 
---   A dead thread has completed or aborted its execution or has been terminated.
--- 
---   It cannot be resumed(`t:resume()`) nor suspended(`t:suspend()`).
---   A dead thread does not block a parent process from closing.
---   Killing a dead thread is not an error but does nothing.
---@return OC.ThreadHandle.Status
function thread_handle_api:status() end

--- Attaches a thread to a process, conventionally known as a child thread or attached thread.
---
--- `level` is an optional used to get parent processes, 0 or nil uses the currently running process.
---
--- When initially created a thread is already attached to the current process.
--- This method returns nil and an error message if `level` refers to a nonexistent process, otherwise it returns truthy.
---
--- An attached thread blocks its parent process from closing until the thread dies (or is killed, or the parent process aborts).
---@param level number?
---@return boolean, string?
function thread_handle_api:attach(level) end

--- Detaches a thread from its parent if it has one.
--- 
--- Returns nil and an error message if no action was taken, otherwise returns self (handy if you want to create and detach a thread in one line).
--- 
--- A detached thread will continue to run until the computer is shutdown or rebooted, or the thread dies.
---@return OC.ThreadHandle, string?
function thread_handle_api:detach() end

--- Blocks the caller until `t` is no longer running or (optionally) returns `false` if `timeout` seconds is reached.
--- After a call to `t:join()` the thread state is “dead”.
--- 
--- Any of the following circumstances allow join to finish and unblock the caller:
--- - The thread continues running until it returns from its thread function.
--- - The thread aborts, or throws an uncaught exception.
--- - The thread is suspended.
--- - The thread is killed.
--- 
--- Calling `thread.waitForAll({t})` is functionally equivalent to calling `t:join()`.
--- When a process is closing it will call `thread.waitForAll()` on the group of its child threads if it has any.
--- A child thread blocks its parent thread by the same machanism.
---@param timeout number
---@return boolean, string?
function thread_handle_api:join(timeout) end

-- Thread API

---@class OC.Thread
local thread_api = {}

---Starts a new thread executing the function `thread_proc` and returns its thread handle,
---see [Thread Handle API](https://ocdoc.cil.li/api:thread#thread_handle_api).
---
---This method takes an optional `...` which is passed to `thread_proc`.
---The runtime of the thread continues autonomously.
---@param thread_proc function
---@param ... any
---@return OC.ThreadHandle
function thread_api.create(thread_proc, ...) end

---Returns the current thread handle.
---
---The init process does not represent a thread and nothing is returned
---from this method if called from the init process and not inside any thread.
---@return OC.ThreadHandle?
function thread_api.current() end

---Waits for the array of threads to complete.
---
---This blocking call can return in timeout seconds if provided.
---Returns success and an error message on failure.
---
---A thread is “completed” under multiple conditions, see `t:join()` for details.
---@param threads OC.ThreadHandle[]
---@param timeout number
---@return boolean, string?
function thread_api.waitForAll(threads, timeout) end

---Waits for any single thread to complete and is otherwise equivalent to `thread.waitForAll()`.
---@param threads OC.ThreadHandle[]
---@param timeout number
---@return boolean, string?
function thread_api.waitForAny(threads, timeout) end

return thread_api
